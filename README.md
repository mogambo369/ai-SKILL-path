## Features

- **Personalized AI Recommendations**
  - Machine learning models recommend the best courses based on user profile, learning pace, skills, and market demand.
  - NLP-powered goal and resume parsing for truly personalized career advice.

- **Skill Assessment and Gap Analysis**
  - Real AI models assess your baseline skills and highlight critical gaps using interactive dashboards and confidence metrics.

- **Blockchain-based Certification (Hyperledger Fabric)**
  - All skill achievements and course completions are logged as verifiable records on Hyperledger Fabric.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (Next.js), TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend API:** Next.js API routes (Node.js), Python for AI/ML microservices (FastAPI/Flask)
- **AI/ML:** Python, scikit-learn, transformers (Huggingface), custom models (recommendation, skill assessment, NLP-explanations)
- **Blockchain:** Hyperledger Fabric (chaincode in Go), Node.js gateway to Fabric SDK
- **Database:** (Add here if using Supabase/Postgres etc.)
- **DevOps:** Docker for easy deployment

## How It Works

1. **Onboarding:** Users login & provide skill info or upload a resume (parsed with NLP).
2. **AI Assessment:** AI models analyze skill profile, history, and market trends for a 360Â° fit.
3. **Learning Path Generation:** Recommended courses, upskilling areas, and a personalized pathway are shown.
4. **Course Progress:** As users complete courses, the backend triggers Hyperledger smart contracts to certify achievements on-chain.
5. **Trust/Audit:** Skill certificates and recommendations are *publicly* auditable (for employers, partners, hackathons, etc).
